# Books-Price-Prediction

This project is done when participating Find-IT Data Analytics Competition held by KMTETI UGM. <br/>
The main objective is to predict the price of the books based on the variables.<br/>
There are 38 dependent variables and 1 independen variable which is the price.<br/>
Almost all of the variables have lots of missing value which make it impossible to only delete data that has missing values.<br/>
The workflow of this code is starting with imputing the missing values of the variables using Machine Learning and Neural Network model one by one. Then, after all missing values are imputed, price prediction model is trained.
